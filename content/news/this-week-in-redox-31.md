# What's new in Redox?

## TL;DR

Hello and welcome to another issue of This Week in Redox! 

The Last two weeks we have been busy working on some cool and exciting stuff! 

Let's start with the no-so-exciting things. That is: **bootloader** and **drivers** got their LICENSE file. 

Moving on to the super exciting territory we have [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) (who else!?), who has been pretty busy standing on [@ids1024](https://github.com/ids1024)'s shoulders and his GSoC work on self hosting. He has been implementing the remaining tasks and fixing the outstanding issues preventing us to run `rustc` and `cargo` inside Redox. This is a big deal! As is the crucial step on making Redox OS self hosted.

**kernel**wise [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) implemented interrupting on signals on pipes. He also made a hack to allow `rustc` to wait on non-child processes and incorporated a new `sys:syscall` scheme with the objective of seeing active system calls. He also migrated the **kernel** from the `collections` library and shipped many fixes to `waitpid`.

On the **Ion** side of things (and pretty much as always) we have a ton of stuff! But without a doubt, the highlights are for [@chrisvittal](https://github.com/chrisvittal)'s implementation of multiple redirection, enabling us to do things like: `cmd <file1 <file2 ^>> err-log > output | cmd2`. For more details on why this is such a big deal you might want to go the [PR](https://github.com/redox-os/ion/pull/553) link. Also, [@Shiwin](https://github.com/Shiwin) implemented `$regex_replace` while [@mmstick](https://github.com/mmstick) implemented `!!`, `!$` `!0`, `!^` and `!*`.

There was lots of activity on the **cookbook** too: The addition of man pages by [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51), [@NilSet](https://github.com/NilSet) adding a recipe for `PrBoom` (Yes! we *almost* run doom!). Mr [@goyox86](https://github.com/goyox86) adding support for the recently released `fd`, [@sajattack](https://github.com/sajattack) porting `termplay` finishing up with [@xTibor](https://github.com/xTibor) who added a `vttest` recipe.

**Orbterm** saw [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) updating `ransid` which improved significantly ANSI compliance. Versions `0.2.0`, `0.2.1` and `0.2.2` were also released while [@xTibor](https://github.com/xTibor) made some updates to use the new `ransid` color handling. 

As mentioned before, **ransid**, our backend for terminal emulators got some love. It's ANSI compliance was improved significantly. Notably, versions `0.3.1`, `0.3.2`, `0.3.3` and `0.3.4` shipped improvements to unknown escapes parsing, corrections on csi handling of missing escapes and fixes for cursor movement csis.

Stopping on the utilities station we have: **userutils**, **coreutils** and **extrautils** getting `man` pages and **netutils**'s `dhcpd` gaining the ability to broadcast packets.

Last but never least [@sajattack](https://github.com/sajattack) added some networking headers to our fork of the **newlib** C standard library (Which we implement in Rust :) and did some nice additions/updates to the book, particularly the documentation of the Redox components. Go give it a look, feedback is appreciated!

Looking forward to a next issue potentially talking about `rustc` and `cargo` running on Redox <3.

See you soon!
